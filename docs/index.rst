Welcome to asyncpgsa's 
=====================================

A python library wrapper around asyncpg for use with sqlalchemy.


sqlalchemy ORM
==============
Currently this repo does not support SA ORM, only SA Core.

As we at canopy do not use the ORM, if you would like to have ORM support feel free to PR it. You would need to create an "engine" interface, and that should be it. Then you can bind your sessions to the engine.
